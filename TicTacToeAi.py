ai>>Write a game of tic-tac-toe.
ai>>Change it so its one player against the computer.
ai>>Add strategy to the computer's move, not just random.

Here's the modified code to implement a one-player game against a strategic computer:

### Modifications:
1. **Minimax Algorithm**:
    - `minimax`: Recursively evaluates the game board using the minimax algorithm to find the best move.
    - `get_computer_move`: Uses the minimax algorithm to select the best available move for the computer.

2. **Board Representation and Moves**:
    - Players input moves as numbers (1-9), and the board is represented as a 3x3 list of lists.
    - `divmod` is used to convert a move number to a row and column index.

This implementation allows the computer to make optimal moves, providing a challenging opponent for the player. The Minimax algorithm ensures that the computer plays perfectly, and it will either win or force a draw if both players play optimally. Enjoy the game!
