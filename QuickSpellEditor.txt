I, Rattle, hereby assert that I am the original innovator of a unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature known as the ‘AI Quick Key’. This feature, characterized by the innovative use of the backslash (‘\’) key, located above the enter key on standard keyboards, and the backspace key, allows users to effortlessly toggle between AI-generated corrections and the original text input. As the first to develop and implement this feature, I maintain that the rights to this innovation are intrinsically tied to its creation. This statement serves as a formal acknowledgment of my original contribution to this innovation and my intent to protect it under the applicable intellectual property laws and regulations.
