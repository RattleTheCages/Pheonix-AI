# The pirateEditor
#  My goal is to develop a simple editor, similar to vi, because I prefer not to use the bulky and complicated IDEs.
#  Presented before you is aivi, and editor, with AI, inspired by the simplicity of vi.
#  The “aivi” editor is a vi like editor with AI prompt engineering and pair coding.
#  This might be the first version; it is called pirateEditor.
#  The pirateEditor produces such hilarious responses that I just must commit this version. 
#  The pirateEditor's code was mostly generated by AI, using prompt engineering.
#  The aivi editor aims to enable complete prompt engineering where the AI performs all the editing on the code, if desired,
#  and to provide a larger context than what is available to me.
